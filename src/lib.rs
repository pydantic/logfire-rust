//! # Rust SDK for Pydantic Logfire
//!
//! From the team behind Pydantic Validation, **Pydantic Logfire** is an observability platform built on the same belief as our open source library â€” that the most powerful tools can be easy to use.
//!
//! The most important API is [`logfire::configure()`][configure], which is used to set up
//! integrations with `tracing` and `log`, as well as exporters for `opentelemetry`. Code
//! instrumented using `tracing` and `log` will *just work* once this configuration is in place.
//!
//! This SDK also offers opinionated functions to instrument code following Logfire's design principles:
//!   - **traces**: [`logfire::span!()`][span] to create a span with structured data.
//!   - **logs**: [`logfire::info!()`][info], [`logfire::debug!()`][debug] and similar macros to log messages
//!     with structured data.
//!   - **metrics**: [`logfire::u64_counter()`][u64_counter] and similar functions.
//!
//! See the [Logfire documentation](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/) for more information about
//! Logfire in general, and the [Logfire GitHub repository](https://github.com/pydantic/logfire) for
//! the source of that documentation, the Python SDK and an issue tracker for general questions
//! about Logfire.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! The setup for this SDK is a quick three-step process:
//!  1. Add the `logfire` crate to your `Cargo.toml`.
//!  2. Call [`logfire::configure()`][configure] at the start of your program to set up the SDK.
//!  3. Run your application with the [`LOGFIRE_TOKEN`] environment variable set to connect it to the Logfire platform.
//!
//! This process is demonstrated below. The [usage guide][usage] contains more detailed information about how to use this
//! SDK to its full potential.
//!
//! ## Getting Started
//!
//! To use `logfire` in your Rust project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
#![doc = concat!("logfire = \"", env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"), "\"\n")]
//! ```
//!
//! Then, in your Rust code, add a call to [`logfire::configure()`][configure] at the beginning of your program:
//!
//! ```rust
//! fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//!     let logfire = logfire::configure()
//!         .install_panic_handler()
//! #        .send_to_logfire(logfire::config::SendToLogfire::IfTokenPresent)
//!         .finish()?;
//!
//!     let _guard = logfire.shutdown_guard();
//!
//!     logfire::info!("Hello world");
//!
//!     // Guard automatically shuts down Logfire when it goes out of scope
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Configuration
//!
//! After adding basic setup as per above, the most two important environment variables are:
//! - [`LOGFIRE_TOKEN`] (required) - the token to send data to the Logfire platform
//! - [`RUST_LOG`](https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/#filtering-results) (optional) - the level of verbosity to send to the Logfire platform. By default
//!   data is captured at `TRACE` level so that all data is available for you to analyze in the
//!   Logfire platform. This format should match the format used by the [`env_logger`](https://docs.rs/env_logger/) crate.
//!
//! All environment variables supported by the Rust Opentelemetry SDK are also supported by the
//! Logfire SDK.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! See [examples][usage::examples] subchapter of this documentation.
//!
//! [`LOGFIRE_TOKEN`]: https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/how-to-guides/create-write-tokens/
